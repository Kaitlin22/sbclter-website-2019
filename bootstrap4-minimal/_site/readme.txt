boilerplate, and getting started with css, includes, etc. 

FOOTER STYLING:
did not do the footer styling and social media links. 
used minimal so far. if you need to add more, eg, NSF logo, links, look in part-2

part 3 has you adding blog posts, and showing titles on the first page. you coudl copy all this from
the bon style (and use for news). bon site has two types, posts and articles.

used this to set up the basic dirs, and index pages for sections (with articles) 


pagination: this lesson has info about adding pagination. a news section can use that. later.
hint: its a plugin, which is a config-reload.
