            <p>The Santa Barbara Coastal LTER (SBC LTER)
    is an interdisciplinary research and education program established in April 2000 with 
    the goal of advancing a predictive understanding of how oceanic and terrestrial 
    processes alter material flows to influence 
    the ecology of coastal ecosystems. It focuses on the semi-arid coast and nearshore waters 
    of southern California where the movement and exchange of materials in the ocean and on 
    land are highly seasonal and episodic. SBCâ€™s principal study domain is a 10,000 km2 area that 
    includes the Santa Barbara Channel, in the northern portion of the Southern California Bight
    and the steep coastal watersheds, small estuaries and sandy beaches that border the Channel.</p> 

        <p>SBC LTER is housed at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) 
    and is part of the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network, a
    program was established by the NSF in 1980 to support research on long-term ecological phenomena.</p>

        <p>Giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) forests are located at the land-ocean margin in temperate regions 
    of both the northern and southern hemispheres, and represent one of the most productive ecosystems 
    in the world.</p>
