  abstract: Long-term data on the abundance of ~250 species of algae, invertebrates
    and fish, collected each summer on permanent 80 meter square transects (40 x 2m)
    at 9 mainland and 2 Santa Cruz Island reef sites. Data collection began in the
    summer of 2000 and continues annually to provide information on community structure,
    population dynamics and species change at local reefs.

    of consistent annual giant kelp loss arising from winter storms. The following
    manipulations are being currently maintained: Control- M. pyrifera surface canopy
    is left intact; Annual removal- M. pyrifera is removed once each winter and allowed
    to re-colonize over the course of the year, and Continuous removal- M. pyrifera
    is removed on each sampling date. The experiment began in 2008, and the continuous-removal
    treatment began in April, 2010.'
