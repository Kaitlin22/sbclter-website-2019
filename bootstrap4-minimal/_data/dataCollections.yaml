    twice per season in permanent transects (40 x 2 meter) at five permanent sites

    the consequences of consistent annual giant kelp loss arising from winter storms.
    The following manipulations were maintained: Control- M. pyrifera surface canopy
    was left intact; Annual removal- M. pyrifera was removed once each winter and
    allowed to re-colonize over the course of the year, and Continuous removal- M.
    pyrifera was removed on each sampling date. The experiment began in 2008, and
    the continuous-removal treatment began in April, 2010. The experiment ended in
    2017 and transects continue to be surveyed to study dynamics of recovery. Data
    include bottom topography for control and annual removal transects. Time-series
    estimates of net primary production of understory macroalgae at each transect

    (NPP), growth, standing crop and loss rates for the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera,
    that are appropriate for examining seasonal and inter-annual patterns. Sampling
    is conducted monthly at three reef sites, and began in 2002. Data sets supporting
    modeled loss parameters are included (blade content, lifespan, loss and DOC exudation).
    Data on the allometry and lifespan of giant kelp fronds, the turnover of blades,
