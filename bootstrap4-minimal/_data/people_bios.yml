In 2001, <em>Watersipora</em> occurred on only one of seven pl atforms surveyed, but in high cover, suggesting that it can become a domina nt member of the invertebrate assemblage on platforms. To better understand and manage the spread of this species, our team is using both empirical an d modeling results to evaluate dispersal pathways, and conducting field exp eriments to explore factors influencing invasion success. Expected study ou tcomes include the development of mitigation measures to manage the spread of <em>Watersipora</em> to offshore structures, including future renewable energy installations, and to natural habitat, and recommendations to inform  decommissioning decisions required by the California Natural Resources Age ncy in a Rigs-to-Reefs Program."

A special research focus of my lab has been the coccolithophore species Emiliania huxleyi, which is central to the Earth’s precipitation of calcium carbonate, the most important carbon reservoir in our planet. We study the genetic, functional and ecological diversity of coccolithophores in the SBC to improve our representation of populations in the modern ocean, and to build robust predictions in future climate scenarios. Our work has paid special attention to the effect of ocean acidification on the growth and calcification of coccolithophores, and more recently to the impact of oil spills on the physiology of phytoplankton, including neurotoxin production by diatoms. The NSF-funded flow cytometry facility enables monitoring the population structure and isolating phytoplankton cells from natural populations, and the NSF-funded titration system is used in our lab to determine seawater alkalinity using LTER and PnBs monthly sampling. My team conducts molecular, physiological and biogeochemical analysis both in the lab and in the field."
