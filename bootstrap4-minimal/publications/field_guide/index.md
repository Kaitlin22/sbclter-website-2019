<p>This guide contains information on the common marine seaweeds, invertebrates, and fish that inhabit the shallow rocky reefs of the Santa Barbara Channel.  Its purpose is to aid students, staff and faculty researchers of the Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research program (SBC LTER) in field identification.  It also provides those less familiar with the Santa Barbara Channel with a glimpse of the diverse marine life that inhabits the  kelp forests in this region.</p>
