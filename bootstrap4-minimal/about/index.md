    <p>Each LTER site involves dozens of researchers. At SBC this includes includes microbial, 
    population, and  community ecologists, oceanographers, physiologists, biogeochemists, social scientists,
     economists and educators. The shared knowledge of place offers unusual common ground for
     exploring disciplinary intersections.</p>

<p>maybe a paragraph here with some other details? Dan had wanted a way to find out which 
researchers worked in which areas. Ideally, this could be done with another bit of coding
(with other people stuff).  so there are 
two choices: (a) keep it up to date manually now and code it later 
(b) wait till later. </p>

                    <h2>About the LTER Network</h2>
            <p>The events
that influence ecosystems can be infrequent and often unpredictable. Major droughts,
hurricanes, the arrival of a new species, or a shift in ocean currents can dramatically affect the
way an ecosystem looks and functions. Legacies from past events can cause two sites that look
superficially similar to behave in very different ways. Yet most ecological studies are funded just
a few years at a time. In 1980, the National Science Foundation founded the Long-Term Ecological Research
(LTER)
network to provide a longer view. Today, research programs at LTER sites support ecological
discovery on the influence of long-term and large-scale phenomena across a wide range of
ecosystems including arctic tundra, grasslands, forests, estuaries, and coral reefs, and the
kelp forests here off Santa Barbara. </p> 

        <p>LTER sites also serve the wider scientific community by:
        <ul>
        <li>making almost 40 years of sustained observations publicly available</li>
        <li>developing and maintaining long-term experiments, which help to explain the
mechanisms that cause ecosystem change</li>
        <li>providing long-term context and deep knowledge of place for researchers working on
shorter-term projects training hundreds of graduate students in interdisciplinary and
collaborative team science</li>
</ul>
