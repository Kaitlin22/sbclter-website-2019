<p>Kelp forests are spatially patchy and are demographically connected to each other via the 
exchange of individuals and trophically connected to other ecosystems via the movement of 
organic matter. How demographic connectivity among local kelp populations varies with 
environmental drivers to affect the stability of the larger kelp metapopulation is poorly 
understood, as is the degree to which synchronous fluctuations in organic matter delivered 
to and from kelp forests affect the dynamics of the consumer populations that feed on this
material. The research in Theme 3 is using in situ observations and experiments, remote 
sensing observations from satellites and autonomous aerial and underwater vehicles and 
oceanographic circulation models to fill these knowledge gaps.</p>
                  
        <ul>
          <li>Explore how demographic connectivity among local kelp populations varies with 
            environmental drivers and affects the stability of the larger kelp metapopulationas </li>
          <li>Understand the degree to which synchronous fluctuations in organic matter delivered to and from kelp 
            forests affect the dynamics of the consumer populations that feed on this material. </li>

      <p>Below, invertebrate suspension feeders account for most of the consumer biomass in SBC kelp forests
      and they rely on the allochthonous production of phytoplankton as their primary food source</p>

       <p>Kelp forest are patchily distributed along the coast and their rapid recovery following local 
extinction depends on the dispersal of spores from neighboring extant populations, which in turn 
allows local kelp populations to function as a metapopulation that promotes regional persistence  </p>

are fueled by large amounts of macroalgae exported from nearby kelp forests
