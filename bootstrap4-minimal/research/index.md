<h2>How do natural and human drivers influence giant kelp dynamics and alter the 
long-term structure and function of kelp forest ecosystems?</h2>

<blockquote><p class="lead">
Three research themes are linked in a conceptual framework by the causes and ecological consequences 
of the dynamics of a relatively short-lived foundation species in a setting of long-term climate 
change and human use. HEY! - where is my blockquote css?!</p>

             <h4>Conceptual framework of SBC LTER research</h4>
             <p> Kelp forests are connected to each other and to the 
             coastal ocean and intertidal beaches via material exchange. Predicting the causes and 
             consequences of kelp forest responses to environmental change requires integrated studies of a 
             wide range of physical, chemical and biological processes occurring on the seafloor, in the 
             water column within and outside of the kelp forest, and on adjacent beaches. Thus, integration 
             across all three research themes is a natural and necessary requirement for advancing a predictive 
             understanding of how kelp forests respond to environmental change now and into the future.</p>
            <p>Our current research builds on prior results to advance a predictive understanding of how disturbance, 
             climate variation and human actions  (e.g., fishing and coastal development) 
             alter the structure and function of kelp forest ecosystems, and to identify the 
             mechanisms that underlie these processes.</p>
