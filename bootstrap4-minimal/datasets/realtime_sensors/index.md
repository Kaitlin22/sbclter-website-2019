<h1>H1 header</h1>

<p>page has display of sensor data from Stearns Wharf.

use data from SCCOOS ERDDAP, maybe get code from them as well. 
</p>
	
<p>Page we are replacing:
<ul>
<li>http://sbc.lternet.edu/data/stearns_wharf/index.php</li>
</ul>



<p>We can probably get some of the code from SCCOOS, so that our view is a near-copy of theirs:
but with our "branding"
<br/>

<br/>
Data will come from SCCOOS ERDAP:
